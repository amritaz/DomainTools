# DomainTools
Various tools and scripts for accessing and managing domain records like fetching whois information of a domain name.

Though posted on Github recently, this code was actually written a while back for my blog @ http://coderbuddy.wordpress.com, when I had very little programming experience.

Due to other things in life, I'm not actively maintaining my blog or this code, if you feel that there is something that should be improved, please feel free to raise a PR, I will try my best to get it merged.
